#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Belune — Updater launcher
#
# Usage, from anywhere:
#   bash update.sh              # update to the latest release
#   bash update.sh v0.2.0       # update to a specific version
#
# This does NOT do the update. It pulls the target image and runs that image's
# /usr/local/bin/belune-update in a helper container — the same thing the
# dashboard does (SpawnUpdateHelper). Two reasons it is only a launcher:
#   - The updater that runs is the TARGET version's, not whatever copy is lying
#     on this host, so a fix to it protects the update that installs it.
#   - "Is an update running?" has one answer: a container labelled
#     belune-update. An update done by this script itself would be invisible
#     to the dashboard.
#
# Keep this file as dumb as possible: it is replaced during the update it
# launches, and an older copy of it runs on every future update.
set -euo pipefail

# ⚠️ Everything lives inside main() and the file ends with `main "$@"; exit $?`
# on ONE line. Do not "tidy" either. The updater replaces this very file
# (scripts/update.sh is an infra file) while this bash is still waiting on it;
# bash reads a script incrementally by byte offset, so an overwrite would make
# it resume mid-content and run garbage. A function body is parsed in full
# before it runs, and `exit` on the same line means the file is never read again.

  # Everything else mirrors SpawnUpdateHelper (update_helper.go): root, host
  # network, the install dir at the same path, the Docker socket — and the
  # labels. ⚠️ The empty compose labels are load-bearing: an image built by
  # `docker compose build` carries project/service labels, and without
  # clearing them `docker compose up -d` may remove this helper mid-update.
