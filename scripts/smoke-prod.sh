# Production smoke drill.
#
# Boots the real production stack — the real image, the real Caddy, a non-root
# user in a container — and asserts that features are actually ALIVE, not merely
# that the code compiles.
#
# Why this exists: every bug found during the v0.0.29 VPS trial was invisible in
# development and only appeared in production, because dev runs the API on the
# host against a Vite dev server while production serves one binary as a non-root
# user in a container behind Caddy. Two of them — request logging, and reporting
# why a certificate failed — were entire features that had been silently dead in
# production since the day they shipped. Nothing failed. Nothing logged an error
# a human would see. They just quietly did nothing.
#
# So every assertion below is a bug that actually happened. Each one is annotated
# with what it caught. Do not "simplify" an assertion into checking that a
# container is running: a running container is exactly what all of these bugs
# looked like.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/smoke-prod.sh              # builds the image, runs the drill
#   BELUNE_IMAGE=belune:trial ./scripts/smoke-prod.sh   # reuse an existing image
#   KEEP=1 ./scripts/smoke-prod.sh       # leave the stack up for poking at
