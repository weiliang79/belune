// remove it. See runtime.ContainerRuntime for why: the whole point is that this
// container outlives the one calling it.
//
// Two departures from RunHelper's helpers, both required by what update.sh
// itself does inside the container:
//   - Runs as root (User "0:0"): update.sh chowns host directories and talks to
//     the mounted Docker socket, the same as it does when a real operator runs
//     it via sudo.
//   - Host networking, not RunHelper's NetworkMode "none": update.sh's own
//     health-wait step curls http://localhost:8080/healthz, which only reaches
//     the recreated belune container from the HOST's network namespace — a
//     helper on its own bridge network would never see it. Host networking also
//     gives the helper the same internet reachability the host has, which
//     update.sh needs to fetch the target release's infra files.

// updateHelperLabels marks the helper as Belune's, and — the load-bearing half —
// explicitly clears the Compose labels it would otherwise inherit.
//
// ⚠️ A container inherits its IMAGE's labels, and an image built by
// `docker compose build` carries com.docker.compose.project/service. The helper
// reuses Belune's own image, so on any install whose image was built that way
// the helper looks to Compose like a stray container of the belune service —
// and update.sh runs `docker compose up -d`, which is entitled to remove the
// excess containers of a service it is recreating. The updater would kill
// itself, mid-update, right after rewriting .env.
//
// The images Belune publishes do not carry these (the Dockerfile sets no LABEL
// and the release workflow stamps only org.opencontainers.image.*), so today
// this holds by ABSENCE — nothing enforces it, and a self-hoster who rebuilds
// locally with `docker compose build` reintroduces exactly the dangerous case.
// Observed for real in this repo's own devcontainer image, which carries
// project=infra, service=api.
//
// Setting a label to "" overrides the inherited value rather than leaving it
// (verified against a real image that carries them), which is enough: Compose
// matches a service by project AND service name, and neither can match now.
