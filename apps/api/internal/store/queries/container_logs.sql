-- CopyFrom takes plain column values, so recorded_at has no COALESCE fallback
-- here: the caller always supplies it, using the timestamp Docker reported for
-- the line and its own clock only when that is missing. That is closer to when
-- the line was actually observed than evaluating NOW() at flush time anyway.

-- name: ListContainerLogSessions :many
-- One row per container generation that has produced log lines for this source,
-- most recent first.
--
-- Keyed by container_id rather than deployment_id so every source type gets
-- sessions: a database has no deployment row but is still replaced by a new
-- container on a major-version upgrade (and again if that rolls back), and those
-- runs need separating just as an application's redeploys do.
--
-- The deployment is joined only for labelling — it is what lets an application's
-- session read "#a1b2c3 · rollback · 2h ago" instead of a bare time range.
-- Grouping by both keys is safe because a container belongs to exactly one
-- deployment. The LEFT JOIN keeps sessions with no deployment (databases) and
-- the NULL "earlier" bucket (rows collected before sessions existed).
--
-- Bounded: an application accumulates a session per deploy for its whole life,
-- and every row here becomes an entry in the viewer's session picker. The cap
-- keeps both the response and that dropdown finite. Truncation is safe — the
-- viewer falls back to a short id for any session it cannot label, and "All
-- deployments" still reads every line regardless of what the picker lists.
