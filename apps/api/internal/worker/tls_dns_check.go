// DNS precheck.
//
// By far the most common reason a certificate never appears is that the
// hostname does not point at this server: the ACME challenge is answered by
// whatever *is* at that address, so issuance quietly fails forever. Caddy will
// keep retrying and the user is left staring at a domain that never goes green.
//
// Neither Coolify nor Dokploy surfaces this, which is why it is worth doing the
// lookup ourselves and saying so in plain words.

// dnsCheckTimeout bounds the resolver call: the probe sweep runs every minute
// over every domain, and a black-holed resolver must not stall it.
const dnsCheckTimeout = 3 * time.Second

// checkDNS reports a human-readable problem with hostname's DNS, and whether
// that problem is fatal to certificate issuance.
//
// The distinction matters. A hostname that does not resolve at all can never be
// issued a certificate, so that is fatal and may decide the domain's status. But
// a hostname that resolves *somewhere else* is ambiguous: that is precisely what
// a proxy in front of us looks like, and issuance through Cloudflare's orange
// cloud demonstrably works — the challenge is forwarded to the origin. Treating
// that as fatal marked every proxied domain Failed while it was still legitimately
// issuing. It is reported, but it never decides the status; the real ACME error
// does that.
//
// Returns ("", false) when the DNS matches, cannot be determined, or the server's
// own public IP is unknown. Deliberately conservative: a false "your DNS is wrong"
// is worse than staying quiet.
