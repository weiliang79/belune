// apidoc_generate_test.go generates apps/site/public/openapi.json — an
// OpenAPI 3.1 spec — by combining two independent sources of truth about the
// real API, neither of which a hand-written reference can get right at this
// scale (212 routes, 1,829 response field slots):
//
//  1. STATIC extraction (apidocExtractTypes) reads request/response Go types
//     directly via golang.org/x/tools/go/packages — a full go/types load of
//     this package, the same information `go vet` has. It resolves every
//     writeJSON call's data argument and every json.Decoder.Decode target to
//     its static type, then walks that type into a JSON Schema.
//  2. DYNAMIC probing (the same chi.Walk + PAT mechanism destroy_boundary_test.go
//     and reveal_boundary_test.go already use) tells us what static types
//     alone cannot: which scope a route needs. A scope requirement is a
//     runtime CLOSURE VALUE (RequireScope("write")) — no amount of reading
//     routes.go recovers "write" from that without actually calling the
//     route and reading the rejection message.
//
// Not a correctness test — a generation tool that happens to reuse the test
// harness (a real Postgres via testcontainers; Docker, Redis, and asynq are
// mocked, see testutil.SetupTestServer). Skipped unless GENERATE_API_REFERENCE=1
// is set, so it never runs as part of the ordinary suite. Invoke via
// `task generate:api-docs`.
//
// One probe per route: a ZERO-SCOPE token (scopes = []string{}, non-nil-but-
// empty — minted by inserting directly via queries.CreateAPIToken, since
// POST /api/tokens itself now rejects an empty scopes array).
// RequireScope/RequireScopeByMethod reject it with "token lacks required
// scope: X", naming the requirement directly — and the handler NEVER RUNS,
// because scopeSatisfies's loop over an empty slice can't match anything.
// This probe is SAFE ON EVERY ROUTE, no exceptions, and needs none of the
// id-less-mutating-route caution a probe that could execute a handler would.
// A route gated by RequireSession with no RequireScope* in front of it at
// all (e.g. the WS terminal tunnel) rejects the zero-scope token with a
// different message ("this action requires a session, not a personal access
// token") before scope ever comes into it — Scope reads as "none" for those.
//
// Role AND session-only gating are NOT probed at all — both are read
// structurally off the same chi.Walk call, for a reason specific to what
// reflection can and can't recover: a function-name check via
// runtime.FuncForPC sees that RequireRole or RequireSession is IN a chain,
// exact and free, no HTTP round trip. RequireSession is genuinely fixed
// (its presence is the whole story). RequireRole is variadic — its role
// arguments are closure-captured and reflection can't read them — so the
// role set comes from parsing routes.go instead (apidocRequireRoleSet),
// which is single-valued only because every call site agrees; a
// disagreement fails generation rather than guessing which route got which
// (internal/server/routes_test.go's TestRequireRoleCallsAgreeOnRoleSet is
// the same check at the source). An earlier
// version of this file probed RequireSession with a second, full-scope
// token instead (withholding the probe, and thus the answer, on id-less
// mutating routes) — before a peer review pointed out RequireSession is
// exactly as structurally readable as RequireRole already was, and that the
// permissive fallback for an unanswered probe (list a PAT scheme alongside
// session, since the restriction "may not exist") was actively dangerous in
// this direction: it had POST /api/tokens, POST /api/users and POST
// /api/users/invite — session-only in reality — documented as callable with
// a write-scoped PAT, on POST /api/tokens the exact self-mint escalation
// path #16 exists to close. RequireScope(required) is different from both:
// it's parameterized by a scope STRING captured in the closure, which a
// function name can't recover without reaching into unexported runtime
// internals — that's the one thing only a live probe can actually tell you,
// which is exactly why probing is still this generator's technique for
// scope, not a stylistic choice.
//
// SECURITY ENCODING: OpenAPI's `scopes` array on a security requirement is
// legal ONLY for oauth2/openIdConnect schemes — for http/bearer it MUST be
// empty in every ratified version of the spec (3.0.x through 3.2.0; a
// "MAY contain role names" relaxation exists in secondary sources but was
// never merged into a published spec). Belune has no OAuth2 authorization
// server for PATs (scopes are chosen at mint time in the dashboard, no
// flows/authorizationUrl/tokenUrl exist), so declaring oauth2 to unlock that
// array would make codegen attempt a handshake against endpoints that don't
// exist — strictly worse than not having it. Instead the requirement is
// carried in the SECURITY SCHEME NAME, named by what a token must SATISFY
// (not what it holds), reusing the scope lattice's own total order
// (metrics ⊂ read ⊂ deploy ⊂ write — see the comment on scopeGrants in
// middleware/scope.go): each scheme is named for the scope it satisfies —
// metrics/read/deploy/write — plus session. A route needing `read` lists
// ONLY `read` — a token holding read, deploy, OR write all satisfy it, so
// naming by minimum keeps it to one scheme per route instead of enumerating
// every tier that would also work. `session` is OR'd into every
// non-session-exclusive requirement, since RequireScope lets a session JWT
// pass unconditionally (ScopesFromContext returns nil for one).
//
// RequireRole gating is NOT a scheme. A role is not a credential — an
// earlier "adminRole" scheme typed as http/bearer made renderers offer a
// bearer field nobody can fill. r.Roles (the role set, from
// apidocRequireRoleSet) is emitted as the x-belune-roles vendor extension
// (apidocBuildDocument) and a "Requires the … role." sentence in the
// operation description (apidocRoleNote — derived, no "admin" literal); the
// site turns x-belune-roles into `roles:` page frontmatter and a sidebar
// badge. TestGenerateAPIReference's role invariant checks r.Roles against
// api-domains.json's " (Admin)" tag suffix, the one role signal a human
// curates independently.

// its output, and a sixth (time.Time) found only by a peer review's
// go/types sweep of every response-surface type implementing
// json.Marshaler — exactly the argument this whole project makes for
// generation over hand-writing:
//
//  1. pgtype values implement json.Marshaler and marshal to a bare nullable
//     scalar — naive reflection would emit their internal struct shape
//     ({"String":"x","Valid":true}), which is wrong. Checked before any
//     other case, by exact type string, from a table verified by actually
//     marshaling each of the four pgtype types this response surface uses.
//  2. Embedded-struct promotion — handled in buildObjectSchema, not here.
//  3. map[string]any roots — handled by the AST-literal path in
//     apidocResolveResponseExpr, not here; by the time a map[string]any
//     reaches walkType (e.g. built from a variable, not an inline literal),
//     its static type carries no field information, so it becomes a
//     generic-but-honest {"type":"object","additionalProperties":{}}.
//  4. interface{} leaves are genuinely opaque — emitted as {} (unconstrained
//     JSON Schema), not guessed at.
//  5. encoding/json special-cases []byte (base64 STRING on the wire, not an
//     array of small integers — the generic slice rule would say otherwise)
//     and separately special-cases json.RawMessage (passed through as
//     embedded JSON verbatim, neither base64 nor an array). First generated
//     spec had 15 fields wrong this way (credentials_encrypted,
//     advanced_config, notification channel configs, audit log details, …) —
//     caught by reading the actual output, not by design review.
//  6. time.Time has only unexported fields (wall, ext, loc), so naive
//     reflection sees an empty struct — but it implements json.Marshaler and
//     marshals to an RFC3339 string, and the zero value marshals to a real
//     string ("0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"), never null; only *time.Time is
//     nullable, via the existing types.Pointer case below. Verified

**"required" is intentionally omitted from every request schema.** Field optionality in this codebase is enforced imperatively (e.g. ` + "`if req.Name == \"\" { ... }`" + `), not type-encoded — most optional fields aren't even pointers. Inferring "required" from arbitrary validation code is a fundamentally fuzzier problem than the static type resolution the rest of this spec relies on, so it is left honestly unspecified rather than risked wrong.

**Project-pinning has no OpenAPI representation** — a token pinned to one project rejected outside it is noted in the affected operations' descriptions, not encoded structurally.`
