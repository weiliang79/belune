// Unauthenticated by design. The value is already inferable from the served
// assets and response behaviour, and both the UI's identity block and the
// update checker need it before a session exists. A build that was not stamped
// at link time reports "dev" rather than guessing at a release.
//
// `updating` is public for the same reason: a restart is observable to anyone
// as a refused connection, so "mid-update" adds nothing an observer lacks. It
// answers only "is something happening right now" — the admin-only
// GET /api/maintenance/update/status keeps "did the last attempt succeed".
