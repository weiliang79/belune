// TestGetDomain_ReturnsOneAndHonoursAccess covers the endpoint added for the
// polling case a list serves badly: tls_status moves on its own, so a script
// that adds a domain and waits has to re-read that one row rather than fetching
// every domain on the application each time.
//
// The access assertion is the half worth having. canAccessDomain resolves the
// DOMAIN's own owner rather than trusting the {applicationId} in the path, so a
// member cannot read another member's domain by pointing the path at their own
// application — which is exactly the mistake a nested read invites.
