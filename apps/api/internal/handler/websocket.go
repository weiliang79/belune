// The dashboard authenticates with its session cookie, because a browser cannot
// set headers on a WebSocket; a script sends the usual bearer token instead.

// ⚠️ Filed under Platform, not a live-updates domain of its own. That domain
// held this one operation, which put it in the sidebar directly beside the
// hand-written WebSockets guide — two top-level entries for one subject, and a
// reader had to open both to find that out. The socket is cross-cutting rather
// than operator-only (a member uses it for their own app's build logs), so
// Platform slightly over-signals; removing the duplicate entry is worth more.
