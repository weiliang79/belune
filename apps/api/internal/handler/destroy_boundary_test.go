// destroyResourceKinds are the literal path segments this PR's "tokens
// cannot destroy" boundary covers: the resources whose deletion or restore
// destroys real stored data, matching the same set PR1's isOwnerOnly split
// already established (project, application, database, volume, domain) plus
// the backup-artifact routes ("backups", "orphaned-backups" — NOT
// "backup-configs" or "backup-destinations", which are schedule/destination
// config and deliberately stay reachable, same as PR1's treatment of
// deploy-hooks/file-mounts/route-features/preview environments).
//
// "users" and "certificates" were added after a review found DeleteUser
// (cascades away every project the target owns — projects.user_id is
// ON DELETE CASCADE) and DeleteCertificate (an uploaded cert+key is
// unrecoverable) were both missing RequireSession AND missing from this set,
// so the structural test that exists specifically to catch such omissions
// had itself been blind to them.
