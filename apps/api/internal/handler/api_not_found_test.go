// TestUnmatchedAPIPath_Returns404JSON covers the catch-all's blind spot.
//
// The SPA handler answers any path that does not resolve to a built asset with
// index.html, which is what makes client-side routing work — and it also
// swallowed every unmatched /api/ path, so a caller of a typo'd or RENAMED
// endpoint got 200 text/html. A success status and an HTML page is worse than a
// 404: most clients fail to parse it in some confusing way rather than
// reporting "not found", and it made the reference unfalsifiable — the spec
// said which paths existed, and probing a wrong one did not disagree.
//
// Found while verifying the /api/metrics -> /api/summary move, where the old
// path kept answering 200 after it had stopped being routed.

// TestUnmatchedAppPath_StillServesTheSPA is the other half, and the reason the

// on an unknown path returning index.html: /projects/{id} is a real page the
// server knows nothing about, and a 404 there would break every deep link and
// every refresh.
//
// ⚠️ Asserting this is the point. A fix that returned 404 for everything
// unmatched would pass the test above and break the entire dashboard.
