// isGrantRoute identifies the two routes that hand out project-owner-
// equivalent access rather than operate a workload: /transfer moves
// ownership to a named user, /sharing extends it to every Member on the
// install (canAccessOwned's `if shared { return true }` has no membership
// check — see the comment on that route pair in routes.go).
//
// UNLIKE destroy_boundary_test.go and reveal_boundary_test.go, this has no
// uniform SHAPE to discover by: every destroy/restore route ends in
// "/{id}" or "/{id}/restore", every reveal route ends in "/reveal" — a
// grant route is just these two specific path suffixes, named here because
// nothing else identifies them structurally. That makes this predicate
// thinner than its siblings: it pins the two routes fixed today, but a
// FUTURE grant-shaped route under a different name (an "invite a co-owner"
// endpoint, say) would NOT be caught by this walk and would need its own
// line added here. Prefer a real structural predicate if one turns up;
// none was found for this class.

// TestGrantRoutes_RequireSession is the structural half of "a token cannot

// hand-maintained list of route strings, beyond isGrantRoute's own two
// suffixes — see its caveat) and assert every grant route rejects a
// full-scope PAT specifically via middleware.RequireSession, checked by its
// exact error message so this fails loudly if some other check happened to
// reject the request for an unrelated reason — a 404 on the dummy id, or
// TransferProject's own RequireRole("admin"), would also prove nothing
// here (this token is minted for an admin, so it clears that gate and
// RequireSession has to be what actually stops it). Sibling of
// TestDestroyRoutes_RequireSession and TestRevealRoutes_RequireSession.
