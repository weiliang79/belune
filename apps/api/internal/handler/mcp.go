// HandleMCP serves the read-only MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The
// route (POST /mcp) gates identity and scope — RequireToken and
// RequireScope both run before this is reached — but NOT
// RequireProjectAccess: this route has no {projectId} URL param for it to
// compare a pin against. Project-pin enforcement instead happens inside
// internal/mcpserver, per tool call, via pinAllows/authorizeProject/
// authorizeApplication/authorizeDatabase (see access.go). The transport and
// tools themselves live in internal/mcpserver.
//
// Deliberately excluded from the generated OpenAPI reference: it is a single
// stateless JSON-RPC endpoint, not a REST resource, so documenting it as one
// operation with an opaque body would mislead more than it would inform. See
// apidocSkipNonRESTPrefixes in apidoc_generate_test.go.
