 *  authority on all of it. Every source field is therefore sent as typed,
 *  blank included: blank is a real choice for most of them — no Dockerfile
 *  path, build from the repository root, let the builder decide — and omitting
 *  a field the user had just cleared would discard the edit while still
 *  reporting "Settings saved". That was a live regression (a72927c): the
 *  cleared field came back on reload.
 *
 *  The opposite error is just as easy, which is why the other type's fields are
 *  sent as "" rather than echoed back. validateSource rejects a non-empty
 *  dockerfile_path or build_type_override on an image application, so echoing a
 *  stale git value would make such an app unsavable from a form that does not
 *  render the offending field — a rejection the user has no way to fix. */
