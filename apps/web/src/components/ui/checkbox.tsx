/**
 * Form checkbox — the counterpart to <Switch> in the toggle convention
 * documented on that component:
 *   - <Switch>   — flipping it acts now; there is no submit button.
 *   - <Checkbox> — a form field, persisted only when the form is submitted.
 *
 * This exists so that distinction costs nothing visually. Form fields were
 * previously raw <input type="checkbox">, which renders as the unstyled browser
 * control and looked out of place next to the rest of the UI — the reason to
 * reach for a Switch was appearance, not meaning, and reaching for one in a form
 * tells the user their change is already in effect when it is not.
