            believe they are a safety net here. Project deletion removes each
            database and application through its own delete path, and both
            erase remote copies. ⚠️ Volume backups are named here only
            because application deletion now actually erases them — before
            that fix their objects were left behind, so claiming destruction
            would have been false in a new direction. Static wording, not a
            count: an accurate number needs impact
            aggregated across databases and volumes (see the project-deletion
            gap), and a partial count on a confirmation dialog would be worse
