// Merges the two sources the container log viewer reads from — the persisted
// history query and the live WebSocket buffer — into one chronological list
// with no line shown twice.
//
// Why this is not a concatenation: the collector publishes a line to Redis only
// AFTER its row is durable (`logcollector/collector.go`, "so a live viewer never
// sees a line that was not stored"). Every live line therefore already exists in
// the database, so any refetch of history — and history inherits the global 60s
// `staleTime` from `main.tsx`, so a tab-focus is enough — returns a second copy
// of lines the live buffer is still holding.
//
// The two copies cannot be matched on identity:
//
//   - not by `id`: history carries the row's UUID, while the live buffer mints
//     synthetic `live-N` ids that never equal one.
//   - not by `recordedAt` as a string: live publishes RFC3339Nano taken from
//     Docker's own nanosecond clock, while the stored value has been truncated
//     to Postgres's microsecond resolution and comes back re-formatted. The same
//     line reads `…123456789Z` live and `…123457Z` from history.
//
// So a line is identified by its content at millisecond resolution, which is
// the precision both representations survive down to. The opposite trade — a
// high-water mark on the newest historical timestamp — would instead discard
// *different* text that happened to land on the boundary instant, which is a
// silent loss rather than a cosmetic one.

  // message several times inside one millisecond — and for a repeated error the
  // count is the information. Nothing about a history refetch justifies that:
  // the duplicate this exists to remove only ever arises one way round, because
  // the collector persists a line before it publishes it, so a live line is
  // already in the database and it is the refetch that returns the second copy.
  //
  // History is kept whole and first, so when a line is present in both, the
  // copy that survives is the persisted one — it carries the real row id, which
  // is what React keys on.

  // client-side passes. Sorting explicitly costs one pass and removes the
  // question.

  // An entry with no parseable timestamp inherits the last one seen rather than
  // sorting to an edge, so it stays next to the line it arrived with instead of
  // being hoisted to the top of the view.
