/**
 * What one dashboard tab costs, measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * The authenticated API is rate limited per CALLER, not per tab
 * (`rateLimitKey` resolves a browser session to `user:<id>`), so every tab of
 * every window a signed-in operator has open spends from one budget. For
 * sixteen releases that budget was 100/min and shared with automated tokens,
 * and a routine v0.1.16 update drill — a couple of tabs, repeated reloads while
 * watching an update — hit 429 on a dashboard doing nothing unusual. Nothing
 * had ever measured what a tab actually spends.
 *
 * ⚠️ Excluded from the default run (see `testIgnore` in playwright.config.ts):
 * it holds each page open for a full window, so it takes about ten minutes.
 * Run it deliberately:
 *
 *     BELUNE_E2E_BUDGET=1 ./scripts/smoke-browser.sh --grep budget
 *
 * It both reports and asserts. The report is the useful half — per-path counts
 * say WHICH query is expensive, which is what a fix needs — but a measurement
 * harness that cannot fail is not a test, so each page also has a ceiling.
