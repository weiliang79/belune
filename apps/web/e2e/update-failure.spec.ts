/**
 * The failed-self-update journey, in a real browser against the real production
 * stack.
 *
 * This is the drill that was run by hand three times during v0.1.16, and the
 * three rcs were three laps of it: each one found something the previous could
 * not reach, because nothing in CI could reach any of it. Point
 * `update_latest_version` at a release that does not exist, click Update, and
 * watch what the operator is actually told — the clock while the pull runs, the
 * toast when it fails, and the panel that still says so afterwards.
 *
 * Why a browser and not jsdom: every defect this covers was a RENDERING defect.
 * A toast at `opacity: 0` is in the document with the right text; jsdom has no
 * layout engine and only a partial `getComputedStyle`, so the whole jsdom suite
 * stayed green through all three rcs. See support/toast-legibility.ts.
 *
 * Why a FAILING update and not a successful one: a successful update replaces
 * the container the drill is driving, so there is nothing left to assert
 * against — and a failure is the case that was broken. Nothing on the host is
 * touched either way; the pull is what fails, and it fails before the helper
 * that does the touching exists.
 *
 * The environment is prepared by scripts/smoke-browser.sh, which is also how to
 * run this by hand.
 *
 * ⚠️ Verified by putting the defect back, twice, in a real image — a drill that
 * has never been shown to fail is not evidence of anything. Note that
 * `v0.1.16-rc2` is NOT a usable control: the fix was squash-merged as part of
 * #49, so the pre-squash commit is unreachable from every tag while its content
 * is present in all of them, and the rc2 image passes this drill.
 *
 *   A. the original code, restored verbatim — `toast.success(...)` in onSuccess
 *      and no local announce, so the clock came from the `platform` socket.
 *      → 2 toasts obscured; the clock's text peaked at opacity 0.24.
 *   B. the same duplicate raised BEFORE the announce, so the clock is created
 *      second. The ordering the comment below is about.
 *      → 3 toasts obscured; the clock peaked at 0.25.
 *
 * Both assertions below fire on both; the unmodified image passes.

  // just as readily as for a missing tag.
  //
  // ⚠️ Asserted on the "what was being done" half only, deliberately. The cause
  // after the colon is whatever the registry said — manifest unknown for a tag
  // that does not exist, but a DNS failure or a 5xx on an offline runner just as

  // Stated over EVERY toast rather than only the clock, because the defect is
  // "two toasts at once" and which of the two ends up hidden is a race — the

  // mutation's onSuccess, so whichever arrived second won the front. An

  // toast carrying the clock, and the failure toast only once the clock has
  // gone. A change that raises a second toast here is a regression even if it
  // looks harmless, because sonner will hide one of them.
  //
  // The budget is one transition's length, and it is not a fudge factor. A
  // passing run spends exactly one 50ms sample with two toasts live, because
  // the clock's dismissal and the failure toast's arrival land in the same
  // React commit — and the clock's text is still fully opaque through it, since

  // It asserts that the clock's text reached full opacity INSIDE its own toast
  // at some point — so it catches the content being rendered invisible by
  // something within the toast (an opacity on [data-content] or [data-title], a
  // future sonner release hiding a stacked toast by a different mechanism) and,
  // with the sample count above, the clock never being raised at all.
  //
  // ⛔ It does NOT catch v0.1.16's defect, and must not be read as doing so.
  // It is a MAXIMUM over the toast's life, and a toast that is briefly front
  // before a second one pushes it behind reaches full opacity in that window —
  // so the peak is 1 while the operator still could not read it. The assertion
  // above, on `data-front` over time, is the one that catches that; this one is
  // deliberately a different question.
  //
  // ⚠️ Both halves of that were learned the hard way, in the same hour.
  // Measuring opacity ABSOLUTELY (up the whole ancestor chain, including the
  // toast's own 400ms fade) made this assertion flake red on CI against correct
  // code — a fast registry refusal left the clock on screen for under a second,
  // its fade-in never finished, and the peak was 0.851. Measuring it relative
  // to the toast fixes that, and in doing so revealed that its apparent ability
  // to catch the stacking defect had only ever been the element fade capping
  // the peak at 0.24. Proven both ways against a real image with the defect put
  // back: the assertion above fails it, this one does not.
