/**
 * Playwright drives the REAL production stack, not a dev server.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `webServer` here. The stack under test is the one
 * scripts/smoke-prod.sh boots — the real image, served by the Go binary as a
 * non-root user in a container, behind the real Caddy — because every defect
 * these drills exist to catch was invisible in development. A Vite dev server
 * would serve different bytes (unminified, unbundled, with HMR attached) from a
 * different origin, against an API on the host.
 *
 * So the stack is booted and seeded outside Playwright, and
 * scripts/smoke-browser.sh is the entry point that does both. Run that, not
 * `playwright test`.
 *
 * Reached directly on Belune's own port rather than through Caddy: an app or
 * dashboard hostname force-redirects HTTP→HTTPS (correct for a login form), and
 * every defect here is in the bundle Belune itself serves, which is exactly
 * what this port returns.
