    // `exclude` would also discard vitest's own defaults, node_modules among
    // them. A test that renders anything needs JSX and is therefore .tsx
    // already, which makes the two include globs naturally disjoint.

    // Consequence worth knowing: a DOM test written as plain .ts lands in the
    // `unit` project and fails for want of a `document`. Name it .tsx.
